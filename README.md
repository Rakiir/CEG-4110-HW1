# CEG 4110 HW1

To install my program there are no external libraries needed.

When you start up the app you will see a button with the words "Tap to Change Color".  Press this button to change the color of the text to a random color.

Next, if you desire to change the text simply tap the box to bring up your Android phone's keyboard (you will need to select the text if you wish to delete it).

You may continue changing the color of your text, to random RGB values between 0 and 255.  The RGB values and Hex code for that color will be displayed on the screen.
